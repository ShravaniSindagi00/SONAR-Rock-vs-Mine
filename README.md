# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on their sonar signal attributes. The dataset used is the Sonar Dataset, which contains data collected by bouncing sonar signals off different objects.<br>

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The model analyzes the features of sonar signals and predicts whether the object is a rock or a mine (e.g., a metal cylinder). This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques in real-world scenarios, such as underwater object detection.<br>
